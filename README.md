## Building SD Card Image with kas-container

[kas-container](https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/4.1/userguide.html) provides a Yocto development environment based on the Debian docker image. Before you proceed with the build process, make sure to have Docker installed on your host machine.

```
$ mkdir riscv-andes && cd riscv-andes
$ git clone https://github.com/andestech/meta-andes.git -b ast-v5_3_0-branch
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemens/kas/4.1/kas-container
$ chmod a+x ./kas-container
```

AndeSight v5.3.0 includes OpenSBI, U-Boot and Linux source based on the following versions.

* [OpenSBI v1.2](https://github.com/andestech/opensbi/tree/ast-v5_3_0-branch)
* [U-Boot v2023.01](https://github.com/andestech/uboot/tree/ast-v5_3_0-branch)
* [Linux 6.1.47](https://github.com/andestech/linux/tree/ast-v5_3_0-branch)

And, its RISC-V GNU toolchain versions are as follows:

* GCC 13.2.0
* Binutils 2.41

To build a Poky distro, follow below (using `ae350-ax45mp` as an example):

```
$ ./kas-container build meta-andes/kas/ae350-ax45mp.yml
```

### Build Results

Find the built image, bootloader binaries and boot files generated in **build/tmp/deploy/images/<MACHINE>**, such as

* core-image-base-ae350-ax45mp.rootfs.wic.gz
* fitImage
* ax45mp_c4_d_dsp_ae350.dtb
* boot.scr.uimg
* uEnv.txt
* u-boot-spl.bin
* u-boot.itb

## Flashing Image to SD Card

Use the Linux `dd` command to flash the image to an SD card.

```
$ gunzip -c <IMAGE>.wic.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M iflag=fullblock oflag=direct conv=fsync status=progress && sync
```

You can also use the [belenaEther](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) GUI to flash the image on Windows and macOS.

Next, insert the SD card, access the serial console with the baud rate settings `38400/8-N-1`, and then reset the board. It will boot the target from MMC and load `fw_dynamic.bin` and `u-boot.bin` from `u-boot.itb` in the first partition.

## (Optional) Updating U-Boot SPL, U-Boot ITB and Device Tree on Flash

If you want to update the bootloader, find the XIP mode SPL (u-boot-spl.bin), ITB (u-boot.itb) and device tree blob needed to be burned to the flash in the first partition. You can then burn the images using the `sf` command in the U-Boot prompt as follows, or alternatively using the [SPI_Burn tool](https://github.com/andestech/Andes-Development-Kit).
(Please note that U-Boot SPL is prioritized to use u-boot.itb in the first partition of SD card. If it cannot be found, it will use the one burned to the flash.)

```
RISC-V # fatload mmc 0:1 0x600000 u-boot-spl.bin
RISC-V # sf probe 0:0 50000000 0
RISC-V # sf erase 0x0 0x10000
RISC-V # sf write 0x600000 0x0 0x10000

RISC-V # fatload mmc 0:1 0x600000 u-boot.itb
RISC-V # sf probe 0:0 50000000 0
RISC-V # sf erase 0x10000 0xa0000
RISC-V # sf write 0x600000 0x10000 0xa0000

RISC-V # fatload mmc 0:1 0x20000000 <DTB>
RISC-V # sf probe 0:0 50000000 0
RISC-V # sf erase 0xf0000 0x10000
RISC-V # sf write 0x20000000 0xf0000 0x10000
```

### Reset the Board via GDB

Set `<TARGET_IP>` to the IP address of the ICEman host.

```
$ $GDB -ex "target remote <TARGET_IP>:<PORT>" \
       -ex "set confirm off" \
       -ex "set pagination off" \
       -ex "monitor reset halt" \
       -ex "set \$ra=0" \
       -ex "set \$sp=0" \
       -ex "flushregs" \
       -ex "c"
```
